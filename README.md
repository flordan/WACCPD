## <a name="motivation"></a>Project Motivation
In the recent years, we have assisted to a revolution on IT technologies. The traditional centralized paradigm, where the whole application is hosted in local resources, evolves into a distributed model where users have a simple device to interact with the application but the heavy-weighted computation is performed remotely.

On the one hand, the popularization of mobile devices, such as smart-phones and tablets, have changed the way people access IT services. People permanently bear a computing device that provides them with immediate access to computing services that support them on their work or daily life. For instance, a doctor who is visiting interned patients in their rooms queries their evolution within the last hours to decide a treatment.

On the other hand, the Cloud has emerged as the response to the growing need of computing power. Cloud technologies allow any person or organization to use an infinity of computing resource. These services have reduced the costs of having a large computing infrastructure by transforming the expenses of purchase, maintenance and operation into a pay-as-you-go bill.

Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) brings together the benefits of both: it gathers the immediacy of access of mobile devices with the infinite computing capacity of the Cloud. Thus, mobile users can increase the computing capacity of their devices and solve more complex computational problems. Instead of consulting the evolution of the patients, the doctors could simulate the impact of many treatments on them and pick the most suitable one.

Developing applications that fully exploit MCC is not straight-forward. To achieve a high performance on complex applications, developers must face all the issues of parallelizing the application and the distribution of its components. In addition, the developer has to deal with the rapid variability of the network conditions induced by the high mobility of the mobile device. Applications should adapt their execution according to the current conditions; thus avoids harming the energy-efficiency and performance of the application. Facing these issues taking into account all the variables requires a high level of expertise. For experts in distributed computing, dealing with them means to increase the development time of the application. For developers without the expertise, it means an impassable wall.




## <a name="description"></a>Project Description
COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming framework that provides a programming model for developing sequential applications and a runtime toolkit that executes the applications described following this model in parallel on top of distributed infrastructures. The execution model is based on how superscalar microprocessors execute instructions in an out-of-order manner. Instructions to be executed in the processor have input and output registers, and to guarantee that an out-of-order execution will produce a correct result, data dependencies between instructions need to be detected. In this analogy with superscalar microprocessors applied to a software level, instructions correspond to method calls inside an application, and the registers correspond to the data that a method is reading or writing. The runtime toolkit that supports the model automatically creates a work-flow that describes data dependencies between method calls. Besides, as it is done in superscalar processors, data renaming techniques can be 
applied in order to eliminate false data dependencies (WaR, WaW). In summary, with this idea we enable sequential applications to run in parallel in a distributed infrastructure.

## <a name="branch"></a>Branch Notes
This repository contains all the adaptations made on the official COMPSs-Mobile framework to include OpenCL support. Part of the implementations done for that purpose are already included on the official COMPSs-Mobile repository, the integration of the others is a work in progress, we commit to their full integration in case of paper acceptance.

Inside the results folder, there is an Excel file containing all the results obtained from the tests. To validate them, the runtime and applications used to run the tests are in folders plain_apps and apps.

Folder plain_apps contains the applications without being ported to COMPSs. The three applications are implemented to use the CPU or the GPU. The CPU subfolder contains the CPU version of the code and GPU the version using directly the GPU. Such folders are divided in three folders, each containing one of the applications. Within the app folder there is a script, when launched, it compiles, deploys and runs the application on the mobile device connected to the computer running the script. For instance, plain_apps/CPU/BS/androidBS would deploy and run the BS application on the phone. The current version of the GUI of the application does not correspond to the parameters required by the application; thus, they are hardcoded. These scripts perform the necessary modifications to adapt the workload of the application. They might be manually edited to execute the application with different parameters. If the paper gets accepted, these details will be fixed before the paper publication. 

For launching the COMPSs version of the application, there are similar scripts within the apps folder. The folder contains several apps including others beside DR, CED and BS. In addition to the application parameters, these scripts need to be edited to set some variables to configure the runtime.
Variables:
<ul>
<li>CPU_CORES: Number of CPU cores used by the CPU platform</li>
<li>EXECUTION_PLATFORM: admits 3 possibilities. "gpu" so all tasks run on the GPU except for those indicated in the FIX SCHEDULING section to run on CPU. "cpu" so all tasks run on the CPU except for those indicated in the FIX SCHEDULING section to run on GPU. If no value is assigned (i.e. EXECUTION_PLATFORM="") the computing platform is picked dynamically.<br/>
To statically set the tasks to run on the CPU or a GPU, the scripts have a commented section "FIX SCHEDULING" depicting how should the runtime be configured to bind tasks 1 and 2 to the GPU platform.
</li>
<li>DYNAMIC_SCHEDULING_POLICY: which heuristic is used for dynamically picking the computing platform. "energy" corresponds to the DynEn policy of the paper, and "performance", to DynPerf. If no policy is specified, energy is the default policy configured.</li>
</ul>
Other details such as the name of the OpenCL platform and device may need to be changed on the script according to the used mobile device to run.


The scripts build on three tools to run the tests:
<ul> 
<li> git to download the version from the gitlab repository</li>
<li> Apache Maven to orchestrate the building, deployment and running of the application </li>
<li> android sdk with all the necessary tools </li>
</ul>
